### Hi I'm Cody

I've been a developer since 2015. For the past year I've been specializing in headless e-commerce solutions utilizing Next.js, Gatsby, and Hydrogen. I created the first production Hydrogen application, and take great pride in learning new technologies and architecting elegant systems/solutions. I've created multiple figma plugins to improve the life of fellow developers + designers including a typography and table of contents generator.
